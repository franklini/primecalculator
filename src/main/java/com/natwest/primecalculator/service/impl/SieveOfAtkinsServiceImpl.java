     * Get Prime Range(Inclusive) Using Sieve Of Atkin
     *
     * In mathematics, the Sieve of Atkin is a modern algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a specified integer.
     * Compared with the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes, which marks off multiples of primes, the sieve of Atkin does
     * some preliminary work and then marks off multiples of squares of primes, thus achieving a better theoretical
     * asymptotic complexity. It was created in 2003 by A. O. L. Atkin and Daniel J. Bernstein.
     *
     * In terms of time complexity, Sieve or Eratosthenes performs better than Atkins but theoretically, Atkins starts
     * to perform better at 10 billion prime digits. unfortunately you will most likely run out of memory before getting
     * to that point :-(
     * therefore Sieve of Atkin offers almost no real benefit other than its uniqueness.

     * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     * A simplified version of the algorithm, using N as the limit to which we want to find primes to:
     *
     * If N >= 2:
     *     2 is one of the primes. //add to your list
     *
     * If N >= 3:
     *      3 is one of the primes. //add to your list
     *
     * A = Array of boolean of size (N + 1);
     * Mark all elements of A as false;
     *
     * For i in 1 to (i^2 <= N):
     *     For j in 1 to (j^2 <= N):
     *
     *         //mark A[x] as true if one of the following is true eventually (pay attention to the Exclusive OR):
     *
     *         //Part a
     *         x = (4 * i * i) + (j * j); // if this formula for x has odd number of solutions after all iterations,
     *         //i.e., there exist odd number of distinct pairs (i, j) that satisfy the equation, x <= N and (x % 12 == 1 or x % 12 == 5)
     *         If x <= N && (x % 12 == 1 || x % 12 == 5)
     *             A[x] ^= true; // ^ is exclusive OR and this is used to make sure an odd number of solutions are found
     *
     *         //Part b
     *         x = (3 * i * i) + (j * j); // if this formula for x has odd number of solutions after all iterations,
     *         //i.e., there exist odd number of distinct pairs (i, j) that satisfy the equation, x <= N and x % 12 == 7
     *         If x <= N && x % 12 == 7
     *             A[x] ^= true; // ^ is exclusive OR and this is used to make sure an odd number of solutions are found
     *
     *        //Part c
     *         x = (3 * i * i) - (j * j); // if this formula for x has odd number of solutions after all iterations,
     *         //i.e., there exist odd number of distinct pairs (i, j) that satisfy the equation, i > j and x <= N and x % 12 == 11
     *         If i > j && x <= N && x % 12 == 11
     *             A[x] ^= true; // ^ is exclusive OR and this is used to make sure an odd number of solutions are found
     *
     * //Filter Out Non-Primes: Because of the nature of the algorithm, some composite numbers were able to slip through
     * //and be classified as prime. To fix this we can implement the following code. We can loop through all numbers
     * //in sieve starting at r = 5 and if r is prime then the value at the index of rÂ² and its multiples are set back
     * //to false.
     * For r in 5 to (r < N):
     *     If A[r]:
     *         For s in r^2 to N-1 with increments s += r * r:
     *             A[s] = false;
     *
     * Starting from index 5, all indexes in array A still set to true are primes;
